# Hangman game

This project was build using React. 

## About the game

Hangman is a classic word game in which the player has to guess the secret word one letter at a time.

## Rules of the the game

- Guess one letter at a time to reveal the secret word. If a letter occurs more then once in the secret word, it will be revealed.
- Each incorrect guess adds another part to the hangman. You only get 6 incorrect guesses.
- If the player has 6 incorrect guesses, he will be "hanged". A "You lost" message will appear on the screen, and the secret word will be revealed.
- If the player guesses the secret word, a "Congratulations, You Won" message will appear.
- In each case (win or lose), the player can replay the same game, or start a new one.
- The player can restart, or start a new game during an already started game.

## Available Scripts

### `git clone`

Open your terminal and then type. $ git clone {the url to the GitHub repo} This clones the repo.

### `npm install`

This is to install the required dependencies into the project's folder.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
